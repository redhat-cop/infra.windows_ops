  2.0.0:
    changes:
      release_summary: Updated Windows compliance to DISA STIG V2R7 (2022) and V1R1 (2025) with critical fixes for 33 V-ID mapping errors, 6 severity classifications, and audit policy paired controls.
      bugfixes:
      - windows_manage_stig - Fixed 6 STIG controls that were incorrectly classified
        as CAT II instead of CAT I per official DISA documentation.
      - windows_manage_stig - Fixed ``windows_manage_stig_only_rules`` filtering to
        properly restrict rule execution to only specified STIG IDs.
      - windows_manage_stig - Fixed audit policy remediation to preserve paired success/failure
        controls, preventing "whack-a-mole" effect where fixing one control inadvertently
        breaks its paired control.
      - windows_manage_stig - Fixed critical V-ID to registry mapping errors affecting
        33 controls in registry_settings.yml. Controls were mapping to completely
        wrong registry paths and value names, causing remediation to appear successful
        while DISA SCC scans continued to fail. All mappings verified against official
        DISA STIG V2R7 XCCDF (https://github.com/redhat-cop/infra.windows_ops/issues/41).
      major_changes:
      - windows_manage_cis - Added Windows Server 2025 support with CIS Benchmark
        v1.0.0 (210 controls). Implements version-specific controls including Azure
        Arc integration (18.10.89.1), Zero Trust network access (19.7.1), and AD 32k
        page support (18.10.90.1). Maintains backward compatibility with Windows Server
        2019 and 2022 through automatic version detection.
      - windows_manage_stig - Added Windows Server 2025 support with DISA STIG V1R1
        (295 controls). Implements automatic OS version detection with dual method
        (ProductName + build number fallback). Includes 2025-specific features (Hotpatching
        with Azure Arc, Next-Gen Credential Guard, AD 32k pages) and 2022+ features
        (DNS-over-HTTPS, SMB over QUIC, TLS 1.3). Supports unified role architecture
        across Windows Server 2019 (V3R7), 2022 (V2R7), and 2025 (V1R1) with version-conditional
        logic.
      - windows_manage_stig - Updated to DISA STIG Version 2 Release 7 (V2R7) released
        January 23, 2026. This major update adds 79 new security controls and removes
        1 deprecated rule (V-254411) (total 283 rules, up from 205), and significantly
        expands audit policies coverage with 34 new audit configuration rules. The
        update maintains backward compatibility with existing variables while introducing
        enhanced compliance coverage across all STIG categories.
      minor_changes:
      - windows_manage_cis - Added version-specific feature detection for DNS-over-HTTPS
        and TLS 1.3 on Windows Server 2022+.
      - windows_manage_stig - Added integration tests for ``windows_manage_stig_only_rules``
        filtering functionality.
      - windows_manage_stig - Created integration tests for version detection validation
        and Windows Server 2025 feature verification.
      - windows_manage_stig - Enhanced compliance reporting with version detection
        metadata including detected_version, benchmark_version, and version_features
        in JSON reports.
      - windows_manage_stig - Updated security_options.yml with version-aware LAPS
        implementation (MSI for 2019, native for 2022/2025) and SMB signing behavior
        (enforce for 2019/2022, verify-only for 2025 with default enabled).
